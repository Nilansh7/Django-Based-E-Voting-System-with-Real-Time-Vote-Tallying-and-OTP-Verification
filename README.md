# E-Voting System using Django

A web-based E-Voting system developed using the Django framework. This system allows organizations or institutions to conduct secure, efficient, and automated elections. Voters can register, authenticate via OTP, and cast their votes online. Administrators can manage elections by creating candidates, positions, and monitoring voting results in real-time.

## Features

- **Administrator Features:**
  - Manage positions, candidates, and voters (CRUD functionality).
  - Customize ballot order and titles.
  - View real-time vote tallying and voting summary in charts.
  - Export voting results to PDF.
  - Reset votes and manage user roles.

- **Voter Features:**
  - Register and login securely.
  - OTP verification for voter authentication.
  - Cast votes for preferred candidates.
  - View their voting history.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend Framework**: AdminLTE (for Admin Dashboard UI)
- **User Authentication**: OTP-based verification via SMS Gateway
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js (for real-time voting results)
- **Database**: SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL (production-ready)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Deployment**: Local server (for development)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Steps to Set Up Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-voting-with-django.git
   cd e-voting-with-django
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   For Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   For Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all required libraries from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**

   Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Superuser (Admin) Account**

   Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Application**

   Open the browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the app.
   
   - Admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
     - Login with the superuser credentials you created.

## How the System Works

- **Admin Users** can:
  - Add, modify, or delete candidates, positions, and voters.
  - Reset votes, view results, and manage the election process.
  
- **Voters** can:
  - Register, log in, and authenticate using OTP.
  - Cast their votes for candidates and view their voting history.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, installation steps, and usage instructions, making it easier for others to understand and contribute to the project.

1. Project Overview
        • Built an online voting platform using Django for organizations to conduct secure and efficient elections.
        • Provides automated vote tallying, saving time compared to traditional methods.

  Potential Question: What challenges did you face in building this system?
    Answer: Managing secure OTP-based verification and ensuring a smooth user experience for voters were key challenges, which we handled through SMS-based OTP and user-friendly interface design.

2. User Roles and Permissions
        • Developed distinct admin and voter roles to manage election data, with the admin handling CRUD operations and voters participating in elections securely.

  Potential Question: How did you implement data security for this project?
    Answer: Used Django’s built-in authentication, added OTP verification, and followed secure coding practices to protect user data.

3. Data Management and CRUD Functionalities
        • Enabled CRUD functionalities for voter, candidate, and position management, making the system flexible for various election requirements.

  Potential Question: How did you ensure flexibility in this system?
    Answer: Designed the backend to allow admins to customize ballots and candidate positions, meeting the needs of different election structures.

4. Vote Tallying and Real-Time Results
        • Automated vote counting with real-time graphical tallying and PDF export options to enhance reporting.

  Potential Question: What methods did you use to display results effectively?
    Answer: Leveraged chart libraries for horizontal bar charts to display results, making it easy for admins to monitor election outcomes in real time.

  5. Deployment and User Authentication
        •Deployed with user authentication, allowing OTP-enabled registration and login for voters.

  Potential Question: How would you further improve this project?
    Answer: Adding mobile app integration and expanding the OTP system to email options could improve user accessibility and verification.
